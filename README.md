This is the start of an other hobby/learning project. I'd like to build a grocery list tracker app for larger households because it is inconvenient to take the kitchen chalkboard with you to the shops. 

The backend is going to be served on a Laravel based API. I'm going to attempt to make a frontend app with Ionic+vue.

More to follow. This is a 'spare time' thing, so it could be a while.
